          Hello! My name is Cesar, and I'm a passionate and dedicated computer
          engineering student who is really interested in technology and all of
          its possibilities, specially involving the design and building of
          software. Since I can remember, I've always been curious to know how
          things really work and why the work, paying special attention to
          computers, from how they work at the lowest to the highest level and
          how you can create practically anything you want, with you imagination
          and creativity being your only limit.

          I am currently pursuing a Computer Engineering degree at the
          University of Granada in Spain, where I had the big priviledge of
          learning all essential knowledge and more about computers, covering
          all aspects from hardware and software. This academic background has
          given me important and solid foundation in data structures,
          algorithms, digital systems, databases, software engineering,
          programming languages, and more.
